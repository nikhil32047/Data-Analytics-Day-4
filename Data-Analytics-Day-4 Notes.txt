Deep Dive into SQL, Excel & Python for Data Analysis:
=====================================================
📘 Lesson 1: SQL - SELECT Statement
🔍 Summary:
SELECT is used to retrieve specific columns from a table.

🧠 Real-World Example:
At Zomato, get a list of all orders:

SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_amount FROM orders;

📘 Lesson 2: SQL - WHERE Clause:
================================
🔍 Summary:
WHERE filters rows based on conditions.

🧠 Real-World Example:
Get all Hyderabad-based customers:

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'Hyderabad';

📘 Lesson 3: SQL - INNER JOIN:
==============================
🔍 Summary:
Combines data from multiple tables based on common keys.

🧠 Real-World Example:
Join orders and customers to get customer names for each order:

SELECT o.order_id, c.name 
FROM orders o 
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

📘 Lesson 4: Excel – VLOOKUP & XLOOKUP:
=======================================
🔍 Summary:
Used to find data in a different sheet or range.

🧠 Real-World Example:
In sales tracking, fetch region name using product ID:

=VLOOKUP(A2, Products!A:B, 2, FALSE)

📘 Lesson 5: Excel – IF, COUNTIF, SUMIF:
========================================
🔍 Summary:
These apply logic to data processing and conditional calculations.

🧠 Real-World Example:
Count how many orders were above ₹1000:

=COUNTIF(B2:B100, ">1000")

📘 Lesson 6: Excel – Pivot Tables:
==================================
🔍 Summary:
Group and summarize large datasets in a few clicks.

🧠 Real-World Example:
At Flipkart, use Pivot Tables to analyze:

Sales by month

Orders by region

📘 Lesson 7: Python – Pandas DataFrames:
========================================
🔍 Summary:
DataFrames are core table-like structures in Pandas.

🧠 Real-World Example:
Load product data and filter:

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("products.csv")
df[df['price'] > 500]

📘 Lesson 8: Python – GroupBy and Aggregation:
==============================================
🔍 Summary:
Used to summarize data based on a category.

🧠 Real-World Example:
Total sales by product category:

df.groupby("category")["sales"].sum()

📘 Lesson 9: Power BI – Bar, Line, and Pie Charts:
==================================================
🔍 Summary:
These charts are used to tell visual stories from data.

🧠 Real-World Example:
Create a dashboard for:

Line Chart: Sales over months

Pie Chart: Product category split

Bar Chart: Orders by region

📘 Lesson 10: Case Study – Regional Sales Insights:
===================================================
🔍 Summary:
Use data cleaning + SQL + Excel + Power BI to build a business-ready sales report.

🧠 Real-World Example:
SQL: Extract regional sales

Excel: Clean data, apply formulas

Power BI: Dashboard for executive team
